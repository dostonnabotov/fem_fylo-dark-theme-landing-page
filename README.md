## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- CSS and CSS Modules
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first complete project using React TypeScript. Although this project didn't require using any hooks, routing or state management, I learned a lot about how to structure a React TypeScript project. Overall, a great experience.

### Continued development

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve my code, please do let me know! I'll always look forward to learning new things.

### Useful resources

- [Complete Intro to React v8 and Intermediate React v5](https://react-v8.holt.courses/) - I learned a lot about React from this course by Brian Holt. I used the same setup for this project. Definitely check it out!
